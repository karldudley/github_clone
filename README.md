# GitHub Clone - 24 Hour Challenge - by Karl & Liam

## Project Overview

For this project we wanted to produce a GitHub Repo Tracker. The technology we chose to solve this was React and Material-UI. It was deployed on [Netlify](https://github-deets.netlify.app/).

## Installation and usage

Users can enter their GitHub username and press enter or click the Search button. The app then sends a request to the GitHub API and fetches a list of repos. These are displayed on individual cards that can be expanded to display additional information. Cards can be liked and each one contains a link to the repo. The users picture is displayed at the top and clicking this will take you to their GitHub profile.

### To run the app you have a few options:

1. Go to the deployed [site](https://github-deets.netlify.app/) on Netlify (*Easiest Option*)
2. Run it locally - ```npm install && npm start```
